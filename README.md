The primary group randomizer used during Academy Session 13, written in Ruby on Rails. 
Uses edited word list texts from LagoLunatic's randomizer for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. (https://github.com/LagoLunatic/wwrando)
Allows the user to omit absent students and teachers, as well as associate a student with a TA if they are meeting during group work days.
Automatically copies the output text of the randomizer, and allows for re-randomization should a problematic or unsavory group name happens.
